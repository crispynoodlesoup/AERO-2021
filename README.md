<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Hello and welcome to AERO's official github repository for the 2021-2022 FTC year.

This is the brain behind the robot, feel free to explore our code and its internals, we're trying a lot of new stuff this year that we'd be proud to show off. For example we are making a fully functioning implementation of roadrunner to support odometry localization and finite state machine operation. This enables us to not only create a powerful and precise autonomous, but also an automated teleop easy for drivers to use and learn.

Let's all pray for AERO's 2nd year competing :)

<h3>Tip for Exploration</h3>

The bulk of our original code is in 

    [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode)

There you will find all of our custom OpModes and utilities

For FTC samples, look at

    [FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)
