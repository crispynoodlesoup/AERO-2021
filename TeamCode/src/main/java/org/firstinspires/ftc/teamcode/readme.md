## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

This module, TeamCode, is the place where you will write/paste the code for your team's
robot controller App. This module is currently empty (a clean slate) but the
process for adding OpModes is straightforward.

## Creating your own OpModes

The easiest way to create your own OpMode is to copy a Sample OpMode and make it your own.

Sample opmodes exist in the FtcRobotController module.
To locate these samples, find the FtcRobotController module in the "Project/Android" tab.

Expand the following tree elements:
 FtcRobotController / java / org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller / external / samples

A range of different samples classes can be seen in this folder.

## NOTE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMERS

all the custom Roadrunner pathing is in drive/customOpModes

hardwareMecanumbot.java, aerobot.java and aerobotManual.java have all the driver period code I used for this year

ConceptTensorFlowObjectDetectionWebcam.java gives you a live view of the camera through FTC dashboard

Good luck,
Rafael P.
